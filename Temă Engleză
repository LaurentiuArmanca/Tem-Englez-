There are about 30 breeds of rabbits, ranging in colours, shapes, and sizes.
The most popular breeds are the Dwarf Lop, the Mini Lop, and the Netherland Dwarf, but mixed breed rabbits are very common. 
They vary greatly in size with their average adult body weight anywhere between 1-8kg! 
Although all rabbits have similar requirements for care and attention, each breed has different characteristics, grooming needs, and care requirements.
So, make sure that you do some research before welcoming a bunny into your family. Rabbits generally live for an average of 6-12 years.
They are found in most countries but, unfortunately, are agricultural pests in many parts of the world.
